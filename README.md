_A light-hearted card game about tipping â€” and fixing â€” the cosmic scales._

## âœ¨ About

Balance Maâ€™atters is a small, light-hearted card game where you play as Maâ€™at, goddess of balance, fighting to restore order against the chaotic serpent Apophis.

Play cards, tilt the scales, store up power â€” and when balance is restored, unleash it all on your enemies.
Just remember: a little tilt is fine. Tipping the big scale? Not so fine.

Designed as a small project for [Gamedev.js Jam 2025](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2025/).

## ðŸŽ® How to Play

- Play cards to **attack**, **defend**, and **shift** the balance scales.
- **Small scales** can tilt a little without penalty â€” fully tipping them makes you skip your next turn.
- **Big scale** totally tipping = immediate defeat.
- Balance carefully to trigger a **Libra Strike**: a powerful release of stored damage against all enemies.
- Defeat **Apophis** and restore cosmic order!
